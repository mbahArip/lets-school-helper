# Let's School Helper

> [!NOTE]
> This addon is still in development, while it is usable it might not be stable and have many bugs.

Let's School Helper (will be abbreviated as LSH) is a addons that helps with creating furniture mods for the game [Let's School](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1937500/Lets_School/) by providing a set of tools to make the process easier.

The reason this addon created in the first place is to make placing furniture in the game easier, since the center of 1x1 furniture and 1x2 furniture is different.  
For me, it's hard to place furniture in the game without visual guides how it will be placed inside the game.

## Features

> [!NOTE]
> Only collection created by the addon will be used for these features  
> If you already have a lot of furniture in the scene, you need to manually create new addon collection and move the furniture to that collection
